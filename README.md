# Rules
- Issues that contain or link to piracy in any way will be deleted and the poster will be blocked *from the entire [Ryubing](https://github.com/Ryubing) organization*.
- Issues that are improperly filed or missing required information will be closed.
- Issues created/written with the help of AI will be closed.
  - If you use AI in the creation of your issue, please close this repository and go away.
  - If you don't need it, you'd be better off using original thought, and it will be more useful to us.
  - If you need it, you likely can't describe the problem in a cohesive enough manner to the AI in order for to to do what you need, *even in a perfect world.*
    - But this is our world, and AI sucks, so no matter what it's gonna output garbage; even if you could explain properly. See the "If you don't need it" section.
- ### Continued ignoring of this simple concept will result in this issue tracker being archived.
  - I'm not kidding. I'm tired of reading what an AI *thinks* is the problem with a codebase it doesn't know, and could never comprehend.
